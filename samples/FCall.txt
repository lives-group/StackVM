{- This example ilustrate how we can create a function using
   the pc isntruction. We are going to create a function
   that divide a number into it's digits, in the 
   memory, beginind at a given address.
   
   The fucntion must recive: 
      - The point to return after it finishes.
      - The number n
      - The memory address to write the n's digits to.
      
   these tree arguments will be passed, in their order on the stack.
   Also for this example we will assume addresses 4094, 4095 and 4096 are 
   to be used exclusively by the function.
